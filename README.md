### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ross. I'm currently working on [Papers With Code](http://www.paperswithcode.com) at Facebook AI Research. Our goal is to tackle information overload in science and make it easier to find, grasp and extend research.

I've worked on a lot of things in my 20s, including:

- Worked at the UK Treasury during the Eurozone crisis on financial services policy.
- Did my masters at Cambridge in Economics; realized I loved the maths bit more than the econ bit.
- Worked as a quant researcher at a leading firm; researched new modelling approaches for trading various markets.
- Built an open source time series library, PyFlux, with some novel approaches to fill a gap in the PyData ecosystem.
- Worked as a quant developer at a startup; built a quantitative modelling framework now in use at several major firms.
- Started a machine learning startup (Atlas ML) -> co-created Papers With Code to help systemize machine learning information.
- Joined Facebook AI with the PWC team to help accelerate our growth.

So I've tried out a lot of bandit machines :).
