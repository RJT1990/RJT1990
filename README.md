### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ross. I'm currently working on [Papers With Code](http://www.paperswithcode.com) at Facebook AI Research. Our goal is to tackle information overload in science and make it easier to find, grasp and extend research.

I've worked on a lot of things in my 20s, including:

- Worked at the UK Treasury during the Eurozone crisis on financial services policy.
- Did my masters at Cambridge in Economics; realized I loved the maths bit more than the econ bit.
- Worked as a quant researcher at a leading firm; researched new modelling approaches for trading various markets.
- Built an open source time series library, PyFlux, with some novel approaches to fill a gap in the PyData ecosystem.
- Worked as a quant developer at a startup; built a quantitative modelling framework now in use at several major firms.
- Started a machine learning startup (Atlas ML) -> co-created Papers With Code to help systemize machine learning information.
- Joined Facebook AI with the PWC team to help accelerate our growth.

So I've tried out a lot of bandit machines :). 

On the programming side, I started in my teens working in web development and built several multiplayer games including a football manager game, a nation simulator and some roleplaying games, as well as some popular online resources for video games (such as create-a-character libraries for some fighting games in the early 2000s). Oddly I didn't take the computer science route as I didn't know it was available as a kid, so I went the more traditional English route and did something  humanities focussed (ended up doing PPE...). Thankfully things have gone full circle as I am now working on web platforms again with Papers With Code!
